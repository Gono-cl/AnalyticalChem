# üìò Python for Analytical Chemistry  

Welcome to **Python for Analytical Chemistry** ‚Äì an open teaching resource for learning Python through examples and problems rooted in the world of analytical chemistry.  

The goal is simple:  
- Learn Python step by step, starting from the basics.  
- Always apply it to **real problems** chemists face: calibration curves, titration data, chromatograms, spectra, method validation, optimization, and more.  
- Build a resource that can be used for **teaching, self-study, and research training**.
